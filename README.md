# Advent of Code 2020 - Solutions

These are my solutions for every day of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) written in Python 3.8.

Some of my favorite days were:

- [3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3) - Toboggan Trajectory: This was a fun one, the first problem this year involving a visual representation and traversing it.
- [10](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10) - Adapter Array: Very funny. Think of USB-C dongles, Lightning port adapters, ...
- [17](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17) - Conway Cubes: Problem setup was tricky to understand, but it gets you thinking in many dimensions.
- [23](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23) - Crab Cups: Had to implement a LinkedList to solve part 2 efficiently which was pretty neat.
- [24](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24) - Lobby Layout: Enjoyed figuring out cartesian coordiantes to map adjacent hexagonal tiles and how to efficiently keep track the black ones. Drawing out the problem on paper first helped arrive at this solution.

The most challenging problem for me by far was [day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20) (Jurassic Jigsaw). Both parts were tricky. NumPy combined with techniques from computer vision / image manipupation came very useful with this one.
